                <p class="section-subtitle">
                    Reading isn't <strong>just</strong> a town. It's a thriving community that's managed to balance 
                    urban development with green spaces, economic growth with community values, 
                    and progress with heritage.

                    <h3>Rich Heritage</h3>
                    <p>With over 900 years of history, Reading has preserved its cultural identity while embracing modern development.</p>

                    <p>A thriving technology sector and strategic Thames Valley location make Reading a powerhouse without city status.</p>

                <h2>Why Reading <span class="must-highlight">must</span> stay a town</h2>
                <p class="section-subtitle">
                    A tongue-in-cheek look at why being overlooked for city status is actually 
                    the best thing that never happened to us.

                    <div class="reason-number">01</div>
                    <h3>The Royal Snub Collection</h3>
                    <p>Reading has applied for city status <strong>four times</strong>. That's 2000, 2002, 2012, and 2022. Each time the Royal Family graciously overlooked us. At this point it's less of a rejection and more of a tradition. We've got a whole collection of "thanks, but no thanks" letters. It's almost as if they're saying "you're perfect just the way you are!"<br><br><strong class="final-line">We're taking it as a compliment.</strong></p>
                </div>
                <div class="reason-card">
                    <div class="reason-number">02</div>
                    <h3>Size Isn't Everything (But We're Still Bigger)</h3>
                    <p>Reading has over 174,000 residents. Some UK cities are, well, let's just say they're pretty small. St Davids in Wales has a population of just 1,841 people. That's smaller than some of our housing estates! Clearly city status isn't about size. It's about something else entirely.<br><br><strong class="final-line">We're perfectly happy being the largest town that could be a city but chooses not to be.</strong></p>
                </div>
                <div class="reason-card">
                    <div class="reason-number">03</div>
                    <h3>The Cathedral Conundrum</h3>
                    <p>Once upon a time, having a cathedral was your golden ticket to city status. But here's the thing. Towns like Dunblane have cathedrals without the city title. Meanwhile places like Brighton & Hove are cities without cathedrals. Reading's Abbey ruins are a testament to our rich history. We don't need a cathedral to shine.<br><br><strong class="final-line">We've got character, and that's better than a fancy title anyway.</strong></p>

                    <div class="reason-number">04</div>
                    <h3>We're Too Busy Being Awesome</h3>
                    <p>Reading has a thriving economy, world-class festivals, over 100 parks, and a community spirit that cities would kill for. Why would we want to trade that for a title that comes with extra paperwork and the pressure to act more "city-like"? We're perfectly happy being the coolest town in the UK.<br><br><strong class="final-line">It's like being the best band that never got signed. We've got street cred.</strong></p>

                    <div class="reason-number">05</div>
                    <h3>The Reading Festival Story</h3>
                    <p>Reading Festival started in 1971, making it one of the UK's longest-running music festivals. Its sister site? Leeds Festival. Leeds has been a city since 1893. But here's the thing. We started the festival. They got the sister site later. So while they've been a city for over 130 years, we're the ones who had the vision to create one of the world's most iconic music festivals.<br><br><strong class="final-line">Sometimes the best ideas come from towns, not cities.</strong></p>
