# Proud to be a Town - Reading, UK

A campaign website celebrating Reading as the largest town in the UK and advocating for maintaining its town status.

## About This Campaign

Reading has applied for city status four times (2000, 2002, 2012, and 2022) and been overlooked by the Royal Family each time. This website makes the case that being overlooked is actually a good thing—Reading should proudly remain a town.

## Why Reading Should Stay a Town

This site presents a tongue-in-cheek but compelling argument for why Reading's town status is worth preserving:

### The Royal Snub Collection
Reading's four-time rejection from city status has become something of a tradition—one we're perfectly happy with.

### Size Isn't Everything
While Reading has over 174,000 residents, some UK cities are surprisingly small (St Davids in Wales has just 1,841 people). City status clearly isn't about size.

### The Cathedral Conundrum
The rules about what makes a city are inconsistent. Some towns have cathedrals without city status, while some cities don't have cathedrals. Reading's Abbey ruins are a testament to our history—we don't need a cathedral to shine.

### We're Too Busy Being Awesome
Reading has a thriving economy, world-class festivals, over 100 parks, and a community spirit that cities would kill for. Why trade that for extra paperwork?

### The Reading Festival Story
Reading Festival started in 1971, making it one of the UK's longest-running music festivals. Its sister site? Leeds Festival. Leeds has been a city since 1893, but we started the festival. Sometimes the best ideas come from towns, not cities.

### We Meet All the Criteria (But We Don't Want It)
Reading ticks every box for city status—significant population, distinct identity, good local governance, vibrant community. We've got everything a city needs, except the desire to be one. As the saying goes, we don't want to be part of a club that would have us as a member.

## The Cost of City Status

The site also highlights the substantial costs that would be involved in applying for and transitioning to city status—estimated at £145,000 to £410,000+ for rebranding, signage, stationery, marketing, and administrative overhead. All for a title we don't even want.
